    <h4>Hugo Torres Bio</h4>

    <p>
       I was a gamer ever since I was 3 years old, with my cousin letting me play the pac-man on his tv and console.
       My first console being the Sega Genesis that was given to me by my cousin, and then the Playstation 1 with a copy of Spiderman for christmas.
       Ever since then, I would always be on the lookout for the next console, and the latest video gamer.
