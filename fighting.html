    <h1>Fighting Video Games</h1>

    <p>Fighting games can be seen as a 1v1 or a group vs another group. 
        This type of genre not only was popular as other types of genre’s, but it was a very controversial type of genre for how violent it was.</p>

    <p>The first fighting video game is Heavyweight Champ (1976) which is an arcade game, but the fighting game that started the popularity is Street Fighter 1 & 2 (1987 & 1991).</p>

    <p>After Street Fighter 2, a video game called Mortal Kombat (1992) came out which contributed to a rating system for how violent or other mature themes the video game had in the content.</p>

    <p>Ever since the rating system has been established, all mainstream video games now have to have a content rating system of [E = Everyone, E10+ = All 10 and older, T = Teen, M = Mature, and A = Adults Only]. 
        This rating system can be viewed similarly to how movies are rated for their audience.</p>
