    <h1>Platformer Video Games</h1>

    <p>Platformers can be seen as video games that will have you navigate around the area, whether by running and/or jumping. 
       The whole focus of the platformers is to navigate the area, getting to the right destination or achieving a certain type of goal for that area.</p>

    <p>The first platformer can either be Space Panic (1980), or Donkey Kong (1981), and the reasoning for considering either of them as first is because of the fact that Space Panic did not let you jump, while Donkey Kong did let you jump.</p>

    <p>Throughout the years, platformers have evolved from side scrolling with pixels ranging from 8x8 pixels - 16x16 pixels, to now having 3D graphics with art as colorful as a full on animated movie. 
        Inspiring people on the journeys it can take you, and the complex or simple story of the journey.</p>

    <p>Two perfect examples of platformers is "It Takes Two", and "Split Fiction". Both of these video games tell a story that will you take you in its world, and journey.
       By the end of them both, you can tell the developers put in alot of imagination in not just the world, but also the story its trying to tell. At this point, it could mind as well be a full on animated movie.
       "It Takes Two" tell the story of how ...
       "Split Fiction" ...
