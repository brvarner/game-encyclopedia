        Video games have become the most profitable form of modern
        entertainment, with <a>revenues higher</a> than books, films, and
        recorded music in 2022. But this juggernaut didn't arrive overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll trace the humble origins of video games from the massive
        mainframes of the 50's all the way to the sleek smartphones you carry
        every day. Along the way, we'll explore a few of the most popular genres
        and explain how they came to be.
