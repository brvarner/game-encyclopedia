# Video Game Encyclopedia

- Brief Description:
  We intend to showcase different types of video games from different generations, from the 1950s up into the present. This history will go by genre, each with their own page.
  We’re planning to explore games by genre with explanations of their history in timeline format with images and videos of gameplay.

  We plan to source images and videos through Wikimedia, under the Creative Commons license. This license has different levels, most of which offer total freedom to remix and reuse content without charge.

## Pages:

- Home Page
  - This page will introduce users to the project. It’ll have image links to each page.
- First Person Shooters
  - We’ll track the development of first-person shooters from Wolfenstein and Doom to Duke Nukem, Quake, Unreal, and the modern day.
- Fighting Games
  - Users will learn how fighting games developed from the likes of International Karate to Street Fighter II to three-dimensional fighters including Tekken and Soul Calibur.
- Sports Games/Racing Games
  - Sports games have evolved from Pong, the game that launched the arcade revolution, to today’s photorealistic F1, NBA, and NFL video games.
- Arcade Games
  - Though the arcade’s influence has waned, it still played a role in making games mainstream. From Pong to blockbusters like Virtua Fighter, NBA Jam, and Time Crisis.
- Platformers
  - Video games found a home on consoles, which would’ve never succeeded without platformers like Mario Bros. and Sonic The Hedgehog. Though technology has evolved to include three dimensions, platformers remain relevant through newcomers like Hollow Knight.
