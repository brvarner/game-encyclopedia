        Arcade games, while still prevalent, once ruled the world in
        profitability and innovation. Modern games like Breath of The Wild and
        Expedition 33 don't exist without the cultural impact of games as simple
        as Pong and Donkey Kong paving the way.

        Nolan Bushnell, who later founded both Atari and Chuck E. Cheese, worked
        with a team to bring a mainframe game called Spacewar! to the masses.
        Though he was an engineering student in the 60s, he'd also spent summers
        working at an amusement park with coin-operated pinball and
        electromechanical games. He realized that if he could combine the
        coin-operated mechanism with this new form of entertainment, he'd make
        history.

        After creating custom hardware and finding publishing partners, Bushnell
        and his team released

        in 1970. Though this game didn't light the world on fire, it was the
        beginning of Atari whose first game, Pong, kickstarted the arcade
        revolution with simplified controls and an addictive gameplay loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this foundation built by Atari, legendary companies like Sega,
        Nintendo, and Namco sprang to life. Nintendo's mascot, Mario, started
        life as Jumpman in a game where he tried to rescue Princess Peach from
        Donkey Kong. Years later, he's the face of gaming for even casual video
        game fans.

        As these companies vied for our quarters, they spent more and more on
        research and development that led to better hardware, which meant better
        graphics and sound. Eventually, the war moved to our homes with home
        consoles coming into popularity. Even though arcade games are now more
        of a nostalgic item, their place in gaming history cannot be denied.
