          We are two people who love video games and want to share their
          history! We want to show you how they've evolved through the years,
          and to demonstrate how each generation contributed to history.

            I have been a video gamer ever since I was 3 years old. Pac-Man was
            the first game I ever played, my cousin passed me the controller and
            let me play. Ever since then, I have been on the lookout for the
            newest consoles and games.

            Brandon Varner has been developing since 2021, but playing video
            games since he was 4 years old. He has fond memories of playing Duke
            Nukem 3D on his Dad's lap. He one day hopes to become a game
            developer full-time.
