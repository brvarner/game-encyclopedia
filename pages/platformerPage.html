      <p>
        Platformers can be seen as video games that will have you navigate
        around the area, whether by running and/or jumping. The whole focus of
        the platformers is to navigate the area, getting to the right
        destination or achieving a certain type of goal for that area.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first platformer can either be Space Panic (1980), or Donkey Kong
        (1981), and the reasoning for considering either of them as first is
        because of the fact that Space Panic did not let you jump, while Donkey
        Kong did let you jump.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the years, platformers have evolved from side scrolling with
        pixels ranging from 8x8 pixels - 16x16 pixels, to now having 3D graphics
        with art as colorful as a full on animated movie. Inspiring people on
        the journeys it can take you, and the complex or simple story of the
        journey.
