      <p>
        Fighting games can be seen as a 1v1 or a group vs another group. This
        type of genre not only was popular as other types of genre’s, but it was
        a very controversial type of genre for how violent it was.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first fighting video game is Heavyweight Champ (1976) which is an
        arcade game, but the fighting games that popularized the genre are
        Street Fighter 1 & 2 (1987 & 1991).
      </p>

      <p>
        After Street Fighter 2, a video game called Mortal Kombat (1992) came
        out which caused legislators to implement a rating system to warn
        consumers about mature themes and content in video games.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ever since the rating system has been established, all mainstream video
        games now have to have a content rating system of [E = Everyone, E10+ =
        All 10 and older, T = Teen, M = Mature, and A = Adults Only]. This
        rating system can be viewed similarly to how movies are rated for their
        audience.
